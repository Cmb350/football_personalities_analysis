# Football personalities analysis

Introduction
As football fans, we often form specific images of how players behave based on their performance on the field. While each position has certain responsibilities and expectations, not all personalities are equally equipped to handle these demands.

This brings up an interesting question about the different personalities: Is there a personality standard for each position? Can coaches determine a potential player's position simply by meeting and conversing with them? Are these characteristics truly important?

In this project, I will explore the first question by attempting to establish a personality standard for each regular football position.

We provided ChatGPT with a list of successful teams from 2002 to the present. We asked it to analyze sports articles and social media opinions to define the personalities of various players, using the Big Five personality model as our framework.

This straightforward yet intriguing project will break down the personality traits of the listed players and evaluate which traits are most relevant to each position in the game. The Big Five traits include:

Openness: Reflects a degree of intellectual curiosity and a preference for novelty, with values ranging from inventive/curious to steady/cautious.
Conscientiousness: Indicates discipline and self-planning, characterized by values that range from efficient/organized to extravagant/carefree.
Extraversion: Represents positive emotions and a tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others, with values extending from extroverted/energetic to solitary/reserved.
Agreeableness: Suggests a tendency to be social and cooperative, with values that include friendly/compassionate and critical/moralistic.
Neuroticism: Denotes vulnerability to unpleasant emotions such as anxiety, anger, and hostility, with values ranging from sensitive/nervous to resilienThrough this evaluation, we aim to explore the connection between personality traits and soccer positions, opening up a discussion about how these characteristics impact performance on the field in football.

Objectives
1. Create a preliminary standard for each personality required for each position in football.

2. Open the opportunity for a larger project, involving large amounts of data to utilize more analytical tools.
